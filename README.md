## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.
    This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more
    about using this tool in the

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit
    `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real
    time!
